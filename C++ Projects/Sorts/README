Instructions on Compiling and Running program: 
To compile the program, you can run the command: make compile. Alternatively, you can run the following commands: 
g++ sort.cpp -o sort
g++ DataGenerator.cpp -o DataGenerator 
g++ getAverage.cpp -o getAverage

To run sort a single time, you can use the command make run. Alternatively, you can run the following command: 
./sort [flag] [list of integers to be sorted, separated by 1 space] 

To sort a list compiled by a random number generator, use the command ./DataGenerator. Within DataGenerator.cpp, you can 
change the number of elements to be sorted and the sorting method in the main method. 

To run DataGenerator 50 times and get the average number of comparisons, use the commands
make clean (to remove comparison.txt) then make runLoop. The average will print out at the end
